        "question": "How do I create a list in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, you can create a list using square brackets []. For example: my_list = [1, 2, 3] or empty_list = []. You can also create a list using the list() constructor. Lists can contain items of different types and are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creation.",

        "question": "What is a function in Python?",
        "answer": "A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. You define a function using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parameters. For example: def greet(name): return f'Hello, {name}!'. Functions help organize code, promote reusability, and make programs more modular.",

        "question": "How do I handle errors in Python?",
        "answer": "In Python, you can handle errors using try-except blocks. The basic syntax is: try: your_code except ExceptionType: handle_error. You can catch specific exceptions or use a general except clause. It's also common to use finally for cleanup code that should run regardless of whether an error occurred.",

        "question": "What are Python modules?",
        "answer": "Python modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python programs. They help organize code into reusable components. You can import a module using the 'import' statement. The Python standard library includes many built-in modules, and you can also create your own or install third-party modules using pip.",
